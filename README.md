# Shuttle Christmas Code Hunt 2023

[Shuttle's Christmas Code Hunt 2023](https://www.shuttle.rs/cch), inspired by Advent of Code, invites you to solve daily challenges using Rust in a relaxed environment. Each weekday, you will be implementing an HTTP endpoint that returns the solution to the daily challenge, and deploy it on Shuttle. Join the fun, solve puzzles, embrace the holiday spirit, and get rewarded! ðŸŽ„ðŸš€
